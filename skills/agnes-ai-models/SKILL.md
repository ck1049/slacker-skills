description: Configure and debug Agnes API authentication, regional routing, OpenAI-compatible SDK integrations, and agent setup. Use for developer integration questions and API examples, not ordinary image/video prompt writing or generation execution; those belong to agnes-video-director and agnes-generate. Verify model versions against the current official contract rather than selecting a video model from legacy examples.

# Agnes AI Models

Use this skill to help developers integrate Agnes AI models through the OpenAI-compatible API gateway.

Users must register at `https://platform.agnes-ai.com/` and apply for an API key before making requests. Never invent, expose, or ask the user to paste secrets into public files.

## Reusable execution

For actual Agnes image/video generation, read [agnes-generate](../agnes-generate/SKILL.md) and use its fixed parameterized client. Put each task in external JSON/prompt files; do not write a new generation runner. For Agnes video creative prompts or visual review, use [agnes-video-director](../agnes-video-director/SKILL.md). This skill remains the guide for integration, authentication, routing and agent setup; loading it does not authorize generation or replace a prompt-only request with API setup.

## Core Defaults

- Default API base URL (International service): `https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1`
- API key env var: `AGNES_API_KEY`
- Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer $AGNES_API_KEY`
- Official docs: `https://agnes-ai.com/doc/overview`
- Platform: `https://platform.agnes-ai.com/`

## Regional Endpoint Routing

Choose the service route before configuring a client or proposing a fallback. Do not automatically rotate an API key across services after an authentication or quota error.

| Service route | Base URL | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| International service (primary) | `https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1` | Default route for the international service. |
| International service (alternate) | `https://apihub.agnes-ai.cn/v1` | Use when the international primary route has a network, DNS, TLS, or connection-timeout failure. |
| China service | `https://api.agnes-ai.cn/v1` | Use for the China service. |

When a user reports that the Base URL cannot connect:

1. Confirm that the URL includes `/v1` and that the client is not appending `/v1` twice.
2. Ask which service the user is using: International or China.
3. For the International service, start with `https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1`. If that route is unreachable, test `https://apihub.agnes-ai.cn/v1` with one minimal request and keep the reachable route.
4. For the China service, configure `https://api.agnes-ai.cn/v1`.
5. Set the selected URL through `AGNES_BASE_URL` or the agent's custom OpenAI-compatible provider setting.
6. Do not switch routes to solve `400`, `401`, `403`, `422`, or `429` responses. Those require request, account, API key, permission, or rate-limit checks for the selected service.

## Model Selection

Use these defaults unless the user specifies a different model:

| Workflow | Model | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chat, coding, reasoning, tools, streaming, vision input | `agnes-2.5-flash` | `POST /v1/chat/completions` |
| Image generation and editing | `agnes-image-2.1-flash` | `POST /v1/images/generations` |
| Text-to-video and image-to-video | Select an explicitly confirmed current model; use the agnes-generate contract | `POST /v1/videos` |

For detailed model notes, read `references/model_catalog.md`.

For OpenClaw, Hermes, Manus, or other non-Codex agent setup, read `references/agent_compatibility.md`.

## Integration Workflow

1. Confirm the user has an Agnes Platform account and API key for the selected service.
2. Select the regional endpoint using the routing rules above and save it as `AGNES_BASE_URL` when the client supports environment-based configuration.
3. Store the key in `AGNES_API_KEY`; do not hardcode it.
4. Use the OpenAI SDK when the workflow is chat or image generation.
5. Use direct HTTP requests for video creation and polling if the SDK does not expose the video endpoint.
6. For video integration, verify the selected model's current official retrieval contract. For Agnes Video 2.5 and 2.5 Flash, include both the known `video_id` and the exact submitted model:

```text
GET https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/agnesapi?video_id=<VIDEO_ID>&model_name=<SUBMITTED_MODEL>
```

7. Retrieve through the selected service, not a different regional endpoint. For ordinary task recovery, use agnes-generate's stored task record instead of assembling a new polling runner. Retry read-only status queries with bounded backoff for transient errors. Do not automatically repeat generation POSTs after ambiguous failures; preserve the task record and recover the known video_id.
8. When writing public docs or examples, state that limits and model availability may change and users should confirm production-critical values in official docs or the platform console.

## Minimal Python Pattern

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["AGNES_API_KEY"],
    base_url=os.getenv("AGNES_BASE_URL", "https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1"),
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="agnes-2.5-flash",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short intro to Agnes AI."}],
    stream=True,
)

for chunk in response:
    delta = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
    if delta:
        print(delta, end="")
```

## Debugging

For common errors, read `references/troubleshooting.md`.

Required issue/debug fields:

- model
- endpoint
- SDK or client
- sanitized request body
- timestamp and request ID if available
- status code and response body
- expected behavior
- actual behavior

Never include API keys, bearer tokens, private logs, or customer data.

## Optional Smoke Test

Use `scripts/smoke_chat.py` to test whether `AGNES_API_KEY` and the selected chat endpoint are configured correctly. Set `AGNES_BASE_URL` first when using the international alternate route or the China service:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_chat.py
```
